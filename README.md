# Georgia Tech Library retroTECH Twitter Bot
The [Georgia Tech Library's retroTECH lab](http://library.gatech.edu/retrotech) specializes in collecting vintage technologies. One collecting areas has been vintage video game consoles. This Twitter Bot tweets daily an image of an item from this collection with a link to a playable emulated version from the Internet Archive's [Console Living Room](https://archive.org/details/consolelivingroom%26tab=collection?tab=collection).

## Credits
[An excellent article](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15112#note11) found in [Issue 48](https://journal.code4lib.org/issues/issues/issue48) of code4lib by Meredith Hale of the University of Tennessee spurred me to create a Twitter Bot.

Scott Carlson's [Python Twitter Bot](https://www.scottcarlson.info/you-should-make-a-twitter-bot/) was an immense help.
